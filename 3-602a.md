## IBM 602A Calculating Punch (my next project?)

In the late 1950's, my mother (named then Jean Bowe) worked at IBM in Atlanta,
training and supporting customers on Punched Card machines.

She was one of the experts in the Southeast on the 602A Calculating Punch.
Sometime her job required travel to other cities in the Southeast
to help IBM's customers.

The 602A could read in a punched card, read numbers and other signals
off of it, do some arithmetic calculations, and punch the results
onto the same or a different card.
It typically operated on one card per roughly one second.

Since all it could do was read and write punches on cards,
it had to be part of a larger ecosystem of punched card equipement
that could input data, store and duplicate and mix and separate and sort cards,
and print results in some form, on the card (an "interpreter")
or on paper.

## The 602A was Electro-Mechanical

The 602A used mechanisms somewhat like the dials in the odometers
of cars.  The dials would turn to store digits.
The 602A worked in Decimal, not binary.
Techincally, it was a 9's-complement machine.

The program was wired on a plug panel.
There's actually 2 layers of the plug panel.
Finished programs can be saved by popping off the top layer,
and replacing it with a different top panel for a different program.

## 602A operations were described by a 360-degree clock.

Instead of a square wave clock signal that goes rapidly up and down like in modern CPUs,
the 602A used rotating parts.  Electrical pulses would fire at specific
points in the cycle to send information or commands from one part to another.

Programs were "wired" on a "plugboard" full of little electrical holes.
Plugs would be required to activate parts of the 602A and to transmit
decimal numbers from one place to another.

There were up to 12 program cycles per card.  Program Hubs 1 to 12 would
fire in succession, a 360-degree cycle for each number.

Numbers could be read from the card on the first program cycle.
The cards would read in "9 edge first", so any pulses where holes
were punched on thed 9's row would fire first, followed by all
the 8's, the 7's, etc. down to the 0's.  The 360-degree clock
described when each of these occurred.  Other control signals
came before or after all the digits.

## Storage Registers and Adders

<img src="602-cycles.jpg" width="500" />

To be remembered, numbers had to be stored somewhere.
There were a small number of registers and counters (i.e. adders).
Each was a fixed number of decimal digits wide.

Two things had to be wired: control signals and number paths.
Control signals usually started from a Program Hub 1..12
and went to a control input to a register or adder:
Store, Recall, Add, Subtract, Reset.

## Relays and Diodes

The 602A did not have vacuum tubes or transistors.
But it did have components ("Selectors") that you would recognize as relays.
These could be used to create conditional processing.
Once activated, relays would stay active until some
other condition de-activated them.  Signals could be
gated through the normally-open of normally-closed contacts
of the relays.

Diodes might be available (I think they were called filters).
They were optional, expensive, and leaky.
They were used to make sure signals flowed one way,
and did not backtrack the wrong way in a complex program.
They were leaky, so you could only use 2 diodes to any
hub, or the back-current might be enough to activate
something you didn't want. [Reliable Source???]

## The X punch

There are two extra locations on a card that can be
punched that come after the digits (9 to 0).
The first one is usually called an "X" punch.
They are also called "Eleven" and "Twelve" punches,
but those are not meaningful names.

A wire could be split up by the cycle time: A digit punch (9 to 0)
could be split out of an input to go one place,
while the "X" punch (it comes after the 0 punch)
could be routed somewhere different. This "X" punch was often
combined with the least significant digit of a number
on a card to indicate negative.  Or it might indicate
the first or last card in a group, where counters need
to be cleared or a result needed to be punched.

## Micky Mouse Logic

With relays and diodes and other specialized parts, you could be
quite creative at how either program or data signals
were routed and gated.  Selectors had "pilot" signals so that
a signal could be latched and it would alter a later
operations.

You could also combine counters or registers to hold
bigger numbers, or you could steal unused digits
from them and use them for other purposes.

There were (apocryphal?) stories of programs that just barely
fit in the registers, and concern about would happen the next year
if the prices or the tax rates went up, and you
ran out of digits.

## Reset To 5

Here's a timesaving trick that doesn't make sense today:

There are programming hubs labeled "Reset to 5". Why?

Ordinarly, counters reset to "9" or "0" (Why 9?)
(I believe someone told me tha 602A resets to "9"
instead of "0".)

## Zero Check Control

Another part of the 602A programming panel is named
Zero Check Control.  What do you think it did?

## Emulating the 602A!

I would love to build an emulator. It could be rather easy
if it only did easy things.

But to correctly interpret complex programs that did clever
tricks in the wiring, I think it needs to be cycle-correct
in the documented 360-degree clock.

It might be easier to describe in terms of hardware,
such as a VERILOG or VHDL -like description.
But it would use specialty decimal parts,
not your typical binary parts.

I don't know whether I would actually create it in hardware,
like on a FPGA, or just emulate it with software.
Perhaps special-written programs just for these
special parts.
