## @4@ Brainstorming on the Book-Shredders of Retro Knowledge (discord, facebook. etc.)

10 years ago, if I had used a search engine to find updates on
OS-9 for 6809, I would have found public archives of mailing lists
with current information.   Today, all community discussion is walled off.

Can we archive the questions and answers that are disappearing
every day into the ephemeral walled gardens like Discord and Facebook,
and maintain our principles?

* [Stewart Brand, The WELL] You own your own words.

* [Privacy] The right to remove your name, remove your posts.

* [Legal, EU and otherwise] Comply with regulations, both good and evil?

Probably, but it's not going to happen automatically.
It'll take organization and hard work.

Eternal Flames? Perpetual Care? Is there only the Internet Archive?
Whom else can we trust?
